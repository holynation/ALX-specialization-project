# PrivShare

## Project Description
A full web application for file sharing such as documents, images, videos and others. Files uploaded on the app will be stored and will be available for sharing through a custom generated link, then it automatically delete after 24hours.

The 24hrs limits avail privacy and confidentiality of the files as the uploaded file link will be accessible to the user and anyone they share it with. 

The app is a creative solution that ensures the process of sharing files with individuals or groups simpler. Users will be able to share files with friends, family, coworkers, and other people or groups in a secure, quick, and effective manner thanks to the app.
